# **My Blogs**
Hi, there. My name is Mirzakhan. I am full-time software engineer from Baku, Azerbaijan. This repository is dedicated
to the blogs that I write around topics ranging from software engineering to my involvements in different activities, aside from my job. 

> **Note** 
For now I don't have a dedicated website to publish my blogs, that's why Github is the only place you can read them.
